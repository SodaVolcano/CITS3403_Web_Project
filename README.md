## Purpose
This is INSERT_NAME_HERE, a fictitious website set in the future that aims 
to provide a dating platform for humans and robots. In this future, recent 
advancement in artificial general intelligence has produced near-human 
level sentience in robots. In this wave of new sentience, the interest 
in robot-dating has seen a surge in popularity.

Obviously this website is purely for entertainment purposes akin to 
dating-sim games. It is not intended to be a serious dating platform in any 
sense. It is also not intended to be a serious dating platform for robots 
so if you are a robot seeking love, then uhhh maybe go look elsewhere.
