## Purpose
This is INSERT_NAME_HERE, a fictitious website set in the future that aims 
to provide a dating platform for humans and robots. In this future, recent 
advancement in artificial general intelligence has produced near-human 
level sentience in robots. In this wave of new sentience, the interest 
in robot-dating has seen a surge in popularity.

Obviously this website is purely for entertainment purposes akin to 
dating-sim games. It is not intended to be a serious dating platform in any 
sense. It is also not intended to be a serious dating platform for robots 
so if you are a robot seeking love, then uhhh maybe go look elsewhere.

## Running the Web Application
### Setting up the Virtual Environment
It's recommended that you use a virtual environment to manage the Python dependencies, there are two ways to accomplish this
1. Using conda/mamba, this is recommended as it is the easiest. Simply run below to install the required packages specified by `requirements.txt` into the created virtual environment named `myEnv`
```bash
$ conda create --name myEnv --file requirements.txt
```
2. Using the `venv` module, first create the directory for the virtual environment
```bash
$ python -m venv /path/to/your/directory/myEnv
```
- Then,activate your virtual environment
    - On POSIX
        - Shell: `source <venv>/bin/activate`
        - suffix of activate depends on shell see:
            - https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
    - On WINDOWS
        - CMD: `<venv>\Scripts\activate.bat`
        - PS: `<venv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
    
- Once activated your virtual environment, install requirements
```bash
(venv) $ pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
```
